Welcome to test automation suite. To run the automation tests follow below steps:


Copy paste the contents of this folder to your pc in a new folder (preferably any drive other than C:)
If you want to change any configuration like browser type or server URL, Go to \Resource\configs\ folder and change the required text file
Run the testsuite.py file to run all test cases. (You can also edit any tests that you want to skip in this file)
After tests are done you can go to \Reports folder to view Html reports


That's it! hopefully these automation tests will save you a lot of testing time. Happy Testing :)
